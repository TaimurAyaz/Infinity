Infinity is a `500px` popular photos client.

### Prerequisites:
* XCode 8+
* Swift 2.3 

### Setup:
The project depends on some pods, which are included in the repo. If for some reason, a `build/run` from `XCode` does not work, try `pod install` on the home directory.

### Testing:
Testing is based on `Quick` testing framework. Testing directly from `XCode` should work fine.
